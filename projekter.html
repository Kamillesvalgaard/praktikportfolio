            <h4>CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h4>
            <p>
              In this group project, we worked to establish a new website for
              the Danish radio called Radio Loud. <br />
              I was in charge of the group management, as well as building the
              website through idea generating, mock-ups and finished website.
              <br />
              Through working with the Content Management System called
              Wordpress, I was able to come up with our take on how the radio
              could reach their target group the best. <br />
              Feedback from representatives from the radio was amazing, and they
              loved the ideas and thoughts behind the project.

            <h4>BRANDING AND WEB DESIGN</h4>
            <p>
              With Veatery as my case on the 2nd semester exam project, I went
              through all the processes I had worked with, to build a full brand
              identity and marketing stragegy for the little start up company.
              <br />
              Togehter with my group, I was able to do a lot of research on the
              target group, as a basis to produce the right content and build
              the right site.

            <h4>WEBFEATURE</h4>
            <p>
              This exact project was my first time working individually on a big
              task in relation to my studies. The story behind my webfeature is
              very personal to me, as my interview person Ketti has been a big
              inspiration through my whole life. Therefore it was very important
              to me, to build the story as good as possible. <br />
              In this project I especially put a lot of time and energy into the
              interview video you see on the left. Making Ketti cry when she saw
              it, I knew I had manage to portrait her the way she wished, with
              it still being relevant to my task.

            <h4>CONTENT MARKETING</h4>
            <p>
              Doing a full branding and content marketing for a fictional
              product, was not an easy task. Nonetheless very exciting and
              challenging in the good way. <br />
              With creating all kinds of content for the product, building the
              brand from the bottom, I worked my way to making a complete and
              consistent brand identity.
